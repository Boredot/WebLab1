# WebLab1
1st web development lab - website creation using html, css and js

## Task

A web store, where a customer could choose a product, add it to their cart and checkout.

## Realised features

- modal windows for cart, order and a thank-you message
- clean product cards with images
- product cards actually populated with real products(headphone recommendations), not just placeholders
- good-looking(hopefully) buttons
- pagination!!
- footer!!!!!
- idk what to write here tbh, just look at the website

> disclaimer: i kinda forgot about this task and did everything on the last day, hopefully it's not too bad
